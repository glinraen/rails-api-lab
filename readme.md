# Rangular: Build your own Rails API for your Angular app!

### Introduction

Now that we've seen how Rails API mode works, lets build out our own Flash Cards API using Rails and hook it up to our flashcards Angular app!

> ***Note:*** *This can be a pair programming activity or done independently.*

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create a Rails API
- Use version control
- Use rack-cors to allow your Angular app to access your API
- Use curl to POST some flash cards to populate the API
- Replace the URL in your Angular app to get data from the Angular backend

**Bonus:**
- Add a second resource to your Angular app and API

#### Deliverable

Please push your API repo to your GitHub account

### Additional Resources

- Another perspective on [API best practices](http://blog.mwaysolutions.com/2014/06/05/10-best-practices-for-better-restful-api/)

### Self Evaluation

During the previous exercise, rate your progress on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest) for the following criteria:

- **Persistence:** Do you handle frustration well? Do you independently pursue understanding?
- **Organization:** Do you thoughtfully implement best coding patterns and practices?
- **Collaboration:** Do you make an effort solve problems and share your ideas with others?
- **Communication:** Do you clearly convey your thoughts to others in illustrative and clear ways?
